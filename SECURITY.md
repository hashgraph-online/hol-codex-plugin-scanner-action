## Security Best Practices

This tool helps you follow security best practices for AI plugin repositories. For Codex-specific guidance, see the [Codex Security documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/security).

### For Plugin Authors

- Never commit API keys, tokens, or secrets to your repository.
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration.
- Avoid dangerous shell commands in `.mcp.json` configurations.
- Include a `SECURITY.md` in your plugin repository.
- Use permissive licenses (Apache-2.0 or MIT) for clarity.

### For Scanner Users

- This scanner checks for common patterns but does not guarantee security.
- Always review plugin code manually before installation.
- Keep this tool updated for the latest check definitions.
